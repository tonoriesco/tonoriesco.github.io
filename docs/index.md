### Trying to improve everything in my life, everyday

_If i have seen further than others, it is by standing upon the shoulders of giants._

Here you will find my articles because sometimes I need to say something. General thoughts about things that happen around me. I write in English and Spanish, it depends on the topic and what inspires me.

You will find my music, the music I like to play and the music I make. Versions, own music and some live concerts in bars and pubs.

Of course, my photography. A lot of time taking photos. How I see the world thought a camera. Beauty can be seen in all things, in all places, I'm just there and filming.

Some publications on finances. For many people it is a taboo subject, but until you make peace with money, you must fight with it. I have learned many things in recent years.

Also engineering, my wonderful profession and my main income. Electronic engineering has to do with the creativity, design, manufacture, operation and maintenance of things that people need.

And finally, software and hardware, a long time since my first Sinclair ZX Spectrum. Long road and a lot of accumulated knowledge. I often have better relationships with code than with people.
